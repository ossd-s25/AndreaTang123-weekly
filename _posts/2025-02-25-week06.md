# Comment on my small contributions
 My small contributions have been focus on non coding contributions. I have contributed on Wikipedia and on OpenStreetMap. I have been translating and adding new articles on Wikipedia about my favorite Chinese writer. Also, I have added locations on OpenStreetMap about a location around my home in Beijing, China.

# Challenges
I have been want to contribute to open-source projects to improve my coding skills and collaborate with experienced developers. However, finding a project that matches my skill level has been challenging. Many repositories assume prior knowledge, making it difficult to get started. Even beginner-friendly issues often require familiarity with the project’s structure. Navigating large codebases and reaching out to maintainers can feel intimidating. To overcome this, I’ve started focusing on smaller, well-documented projects and engaging with the community. Though the learning curve is steep, I believe persistence and active participation will help me make meaningful contributions over time.

# The contribution I am proud of
My small contributions have primarily been non-coding. However, the contribution I’m most proud of is translating and adding new articles on Wikipedia about my favorite Chinese writer. Sharing their work with a broader audience has been incredibly fulfilling. Additionally, I’ve contributed to OpenStreetMap by adding locations around my home in Beijing, China, helping improve map accuracy for my community. While these may seem like small contributions, they have had a meaningful impact, and I hope to build on this experience as I transition into coding contributions in open-source projects.
