# Weekly Reflection - Final Presentations Week

This week, our class focused on the final presentations from each student group. It was an inspiring and fulfilling experience to see what everyone had contributed to their selected open source projects.

Our team presented our work on **AutoGen**. Throughout the semester, we contributed to both the documentation and codebase. One major takeaway from our presentation was how much we learned by diving into a large, real-world project. We highlighted our work on frontend issues, explored how event emissions work in group chats, and discussed the challenges we faced navigating a fast-evolving and high-skill community.

The other groups also did a fantastic job. I was especially impressed by the **Lucide** group. Their contributions were very solid — they had submitted a significant number of pull requests on GitHub and clearly demonstrated a deep understanding of their project. The way they collaborated, identified issues, and followed through with solutions showed their dedication and technical growth.

Overall, the presentations this week made me appreciate how diverse and impactful open source contributions can be. It was great to see everyone’s hard work come together and to reflect on how much we’ve all grown since the beginning of the course.
