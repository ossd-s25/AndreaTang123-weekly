# I Did That - Firefox Extension
This week our team have created a Firefox browser extention that adds an image to all `whitehouse.gov` pages for accountability.
The image can be **dragged freely**, and its position is **saved** even after a page refresh.

## ğŸ›  Features
- ğŸ–¼ **Adds an image** to all `whitehouse.gov` pages.
- ğŸ“Œ **Movable** - Drag the image anywhere on the screen.
- ğŸ’¾ **Saves position** - The image stays in place even after a refresh.
- âœ‹ **Prevents interference** - Clicks wonâ€™t affect the webpageâ€™s content.
