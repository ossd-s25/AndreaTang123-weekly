## I Did That - Firefox Extension
This week our team have created a Firefox browser extention that adds an image to all `whitehouse.gov` pages for accountability.
The image can be **dragged freely**, and its position is **saved** even after a page refresh.

## ðŸ›  Features
- ðŸ–¼ **Adds an image** to all `whitehouse.gov` pages.
- ðŸ“Œ **Movable** - Drag the image anywhere on the screen.
- ðŸ’¾ **Saves position** - The image stays in place even after a refresh.
- âœ‹ **Prevents interference** - Clicks wonâ€™t affect the webpageâ€™s content.

## Team Collaboration and Progress

Our journey began with brainstorming sessions to define the extensionâ€™s purpose and core features. We collectively decided on an image overlay tool that promotes accountability by allowing users to associate specific content with a visual marker.

### Challenges Faced
	1.	Technical Integration: Implementing the draggable feature while ensuring the imageâ€™s position persists posed a significant challenge. We had to delve into the nuances of the WebExtensions API to achieve the desired functionality.
	2.	Cross-Team Communication: Coordinating tasks and ensuring seamless communication among team members, especially in a remote setup, required the adoption of effective collaboration tools and regular updates.

### Positive Outcomes
	â€¢	Skill Enhancement: This project provided an opportunity for team members to familiarize themselves with browser extension development, particularly using the WebExtensions API.
	â€¢	Strengthened Team Dynamics: Regular meetings and collaborative problem-solving fostered a sense of camaraderie and improved our collective efficiency.

### Personal Contributions and Reflections

In this project, I took on the role of integrating the draggable functionality and ensuring the imageâ€™s position persisted across sessions. This involved researching and implementing local storage solutions to save the imageâ€™s coordinates, a task that significantly enhanced my understanding of client-side storage mechanisms.

### Key Contributions
	â€¢	Draggable Feature Implementation: Developed the functionality allowing users to move the image freely on the page.
	â€¢	Persistent Positioning: Ensured that the imageâ€™s location is saved and restored upon page reloads, enhancing user experience.

### Personal Insights

This collaborative endeavor revealed my aptitude for problem-solving under pressure and highlighted the importance of clear communication in a team setting. I discovered a newfound interest in browser extension development and gained confidence in navigating unfamiliar technical territories.
