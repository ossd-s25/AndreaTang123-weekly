# Weekly Reflection Post
This week was the first one after spring break, and our team quickly got back into the rhythm of working on our open source project. We had two meetings to check in on progress, assign tasks, and support each other technically.

One of my key accomplishments this week was submitting a pull request to our GitHub repository, which was successfully reviewed and merged. It was my first time contributing code to this particular project, and I initially struggled with understanding the project’s codebase and contribution guidelines. I spent some time carefully reading through the documentation and previous pull requests to learn the style and expectations. I also reached out to my teammates during our meetings to clarify a few points. With their help and some extra effort on my part, I was able to get the PR finalized and accepted, which felt really encouraging.
While working on the project, I also browsed the issue tracker and found additional issues that match my skill set. I plan to start working on those next week.

In parallel, I continued working on my personal Wikipedia contribution. One challenge I faced was understanding how to properly cite reliable sources and meet Wikipedia’s neutral tone requirements. I referred back to the Wikipedia editing guidelines and looked at examples from well-edited pages, which helped me improve my own edits. I’m gradually becoming more confident navigating the platform.
