# Reflect on the FINOS presentation
Olivier Poupeney’s talk on FINOS gave me a much better understanding of how open source is shaping financial services. It was interesting to see how banks—typically super protective of their tech—are now collaborating on open-source projects to improve efficiency and innovation. The 2024 State of Open Source in Financial Services report made it clear that while adoption is growing, there are still challenges, like security concerns and internal resistance.

I also checked out the list of FINOS members to see which banks are involved, and it was cool to see some big names participating. One question that stood out to me was about security risks—how does FINOS ensure that open-source contributions don’t introduce vulnerabilities? I added this to the course wiki and upvoted some other good ones.

Overall, the presentation made me think more about the role of open source in finance and how it’s shifting the industry. I am curious to see where this goes.

# Reflect on the OSI presentation
Nick Vidal’s presentation on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) gave me a clearer picture of how open source is more than just freely available code—it’s a whole movement built on transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development. I found it interesting how OSI plays a key role in maintaining open-source licensing standards, making sure projects stay truly open and accessible.

One of the biggest takeaways for me was how open-source principles are influencing industries beyond tech. It’s not just about software anymore—finance, healthcare, and even education are starting to embrace open collaboration. But at the same time, there are challenges, like keeping projects sustainable and preventing companies from exploiting open-source work without giving back.
