# Exploring Our First Open Source Contribution
Over the past week, our team focused on searching for a suitable open source project that we can consistently contribute to as a group. After some discussion and research, we settled on AutoGen AI as our chosen project. We believe it’s a promising platform that aligns with our interests and skill sets.

Once we decided on AutoGen AI, we started looking for relevant issues we could tackle for our first contribution. We faced a bit of a challenge finding issues appropriate for our skill levels—ones that were unassigned and also open for new contributors. This process took longer than expected, but we eventually identified a suitable issue that I could begin working on.

Moving forward, we will continue to explore additional areas where we can contribute. We are also considering reaching out to the maintainers to see if there are any specific features or tasks they could recommend for our group. This proactive communication will help us gain a better understanding of the project’s needs and ensure our efforts align with the community’s goals.

Overall, this first step taught us the importance of thorough research and effective communication. Even though we encountered challenges when searching for issues, we learned how to navigate project repositories more efficiently. We’re excited to dive deeper into AutoGen AI and look forward to making meaningful contributions as a team!
