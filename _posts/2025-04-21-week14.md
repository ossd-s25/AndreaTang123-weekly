# Group Presentations Reflection
 
Last week, three groups delivered their presentations: Preswald, and Hugging Face. All of the groups did a great job presenting their work. Each team clearly and effectively explained the contributions they made to their chosen open source projects. I was really impressed by how deeply each group engaged with the open source community, actively collaborating with other contributors and navigating the process of making meaningful contributions.

Among the three, the Hugging Face group left the strongest impression on me. They not only worked on a very technically challenging project, but also demonstrated a very clear and professional workflow for submitting their pull requests. From identifying an issue, to discussing potential solutions, to implementing and reviewing their code changes, every step of their contribution was well-organized and thoughtfully executed. It was inspiring to see such a high level of collaboration, technical skill, and communication, and it motivated me to think about how I can improve my own contributions in the future.

# Last Week's Contribution
Last week, I contributed to the community discussion by helping answer a question, which made me feel more connected to the open source community. I also made a pull request addressing a front-end issue, continuing to build on the work our group has been doing. We are still actively participating and finding ways to contribute, whether through coding, discussions, or reviewing others’ work. I’m looking forward to our group’s presentation on Monday and sharing what we’ve accomplished with the class.
